      The company was created when the creators were on a trip to Germany. They were exploring around the city of Berlin when suddenly one of them had to use the bathroom very badly. They searched around but none of the stores had public restrooms. There were public restrooms but they were <bold>so</bold> expensive. After reluctantly paying an exorberant amount to use the restroom, they had an amazing idea about croudsourcing bathrooms. Bathrooms sit unoccupied for most of the day. There must be a way to monetize that and do good for the whole world. People would no longer have to waste a ton of money using public restrooms since they are disgusting. The company uses a very efficient middle out search algorithm along with a neural network and AI. The network uses machine learning to predict the most likely places people will have to go to the bathroom and where there are none available. We value all of our users' privacy. We have the best cyber security researchers working 24/7 365 days a year to make sure you have a great bathroom experience without getting your information stolen. We would love for you to join us and experience Airpnp for yourself!
